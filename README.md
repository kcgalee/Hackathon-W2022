# MUSE (work in progress)

This project is a submission for WSU SCD's Winter 2022 Hackathon: "Life at Home". 
Muse is a public online music space where users can create rooms to listen to music with any user around the world. Each room has a theme customized to the host's discretion. Room themes can include artists, genres, or anything the host would like.

## Overview
As per the theme "Life at Home" we decided to tackle one of the most prevalent issues that the COVID 19 pandemic has been causing in people's lives at home: the lack of social interaction. Not only is it a well known issue, it is also something we experince as college students today so it was personally affecting us. After brainstorming solutions on how to eliminate this issue while maintaining social distancing rules and staying safe during a pandemic, we decided to create a platform where people can enjoy lighthearted social interaction...through music! We are both music lovers and know the power that music has in bringing people together. We approached the problem through world wide views and focused in with personal interests.

We entered the hackathon in hopes of gaining experience in React Native so we chose it as our choice of application. JavaScript was used as the main language, and used the Spotify API for music. 

Kylie: Worked on frontend development of Muse through JavaScript, Node.js, and jQuery. Used figma for UX/UI Design
Masrur: Worked on backend development of differentiating and connecting client and server ends. 

We were able to set up a basic version of how the app would look and act in React Native.
